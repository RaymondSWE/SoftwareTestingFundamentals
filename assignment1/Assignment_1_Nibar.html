<h1>Assignment 1, software testing</h1>
<p>This version is for Nibar only. The assignment is the same as for the rest of the class but instead of getting an Eclipse project you get 2 source files. You may still work together with a group for this assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will use Java and JUnit for the assignments in this course. The zip file contains the java files for assignment 1. The software under test (SUT) in this particular assignment is the method findLast(). This method takes an integer array x and an integer y as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of y in the array x. The zip file also contains a file with a JUnit test, lastOccurrenceInFirstElement().&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the test using JUnit. You will observe a failure since the source code contains a fault that the given test reveals. Your task in this assignment is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the fault, located in findLast()<br />
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Line, statement and motivation </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If possible, create a JUnit test that does not reach the fault. <br />
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Explain why it does not reach the fault. If such test is not possible &ndash; explain why.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If possible, create a JUnit test that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state.<br />
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Explain why it reaches the fault and why it does not cause an error. If such test is not possible &ndash; explain why.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If possible, create a JUnit test that results in an error, but not a failure. Hint: Don&rsquo;t forget about the program counter.<br />
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Explain why it causes an error and why it does not cause a failure. If such test is not possible &ndash; explain why.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For the given JUnit test lastOccurrenceInFirstElement(), identify the first error state. Be sure to describe the complete state, i.e., all variables values and the program counter (which instruction it points to).</li>
<li>Fix the fault and verify that all your JUnit tests now pass the test execution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your submission should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pdf file with your name and your answers to above</li>
<li>The JUnit tests&nbsp;</li>
<li>In case you have been working with a group you may submit the same file but if so all names and the group mumber needs to be included.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
