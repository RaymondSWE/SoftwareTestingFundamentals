# Software Testing Fundamentals

This repository is dedicated to the practices and concepts learned in a University course on Software Testing, largely based on the book "Introduction to Software Testing" by Paul Ammann and Jeff Offutt. 
It explores various testing methodologies including to du-path testing, du-pairs, mutation testing with ror, aor mutants, all-definition, all-use testing, and prime path testing.

## The different testing methodologies in this repository include:

### Du-Path Testing:
Du-path testing is a white-box testing method that focuses on identifying and testing all the definition-use paths in a program

### Du-Pairs:
Du-Pairs is a concept related to du-path testing where the focus is on testing the definition-use pairs in the program. 

### Mutation Testing:
Mutation testing is an approach to software testing where the program is mutated  to check the effectiveness of the test cases. Specifically, this repository delves into relational operator replacement (ROR) and arithmetic operator replacement (AOR) mutants.

### All-Definition and All-Use Testing:
All-definition (All-Def) and all-use (All-Use) testing are methodologies focusing on the coverage of variable definitions and uses within the program.

### Prime Path Testing:
Prime Path Testing is a unique methodology that focuses on identifying and testing the prime paths of a program to ensure its correct functionality.
